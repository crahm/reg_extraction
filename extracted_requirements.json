The UK version of the MiFID Org Reg \napplies directly to UK MiFID investment firms. \n1.4 \nIn 2018, when implementing MiFID II, we replicated parts of the MiFID Org Reg into the \nFCA Handbook for certain sourcebooks so that firms could see all the relevant MiFID \nrequirements relating to a particular topic in one place. \n1.5 \nWe also extended some of the MiFID requirements to firms conducting non-MiFID \nbusiness. We extended them to \u2018optional exemption firms\u2019 (Article 3 firms) so they are \nsubject to very similar conduct and system requirements, and we also extended some \nlimited provisions to other non-MiFID firms. \n1.6 \nThis paper sets out our proposals for replacing the firm-facing requirements in the \nMiFID Org Reg with Handbook rules, when the Treasury commences the repeal of the \nMiFID Org Reg",

The regulation is broad in scope, covering \nvarious requirements including: client categorisation, disclosure, suitability, reporting to \nclients, best execution, inducements, research, conflicts of interest, business continuity, \noutsourcing, control procedures and security mechanisms, risk, compliance and internal \naudit functions, remuneration policies and telephone taping. It also applies to a broad \nrange of firms. \n2.2 \nWe intend to restate the existing firm-facing requirements from the MiFID Org Reg in \nour Handbook as rules and guidance with no or minimum changes. We are not proposing \nany new requirements on firms as part of these changes, nor do we propose removing \nany existing requirements in this CP. Provisions we are not replacing in regulatory rules \nwill either be restated or repealed by Treasury, when our Handbook rules are ready to \ncome into force.

Completing this \nshift requires changes to our Handbook, as outlined in Chapter 9 of CP23/32, and the \nrepeal of Articles 12 to 17 of the MiFID Org Reg, which set quantitative thresholds for \nSI determination across different asset classes. The changes to the SI definition in UK \nMiFIR, as included in FSMA 2023 (but not yet commenced), provide the foundation for \nthe UK to adopt this qualitative approach to SI determination. \n2.21 \nUnder the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (Commencement No.8) Regulations \n2024, the new legislative definition of an SI will take effect on 1 December 2025.

Small \ntechnical differences in the drafting of each directive has led to substantial duplication \nand drafting complexity over time. We believe restating Articles 33-35 of the MiFID Org \nReg within existing SYSC rules, making limited drafting changes to maintain the existing \nobligations for all firms, is preferable to restating Articles 33-35 into new rules which \nsubstantially duplicate existing rules. \n3.24 \nFurther alignment could substantially simplify these core rules for all firms.

As we address the application of COBS to ECPs in \nCOBS Annex 1, this provision is no longer required. \n3.33 \nWe propose that the record-keeping requirements which are currently contained in \nAnnex I of the MiFID Org Reg be replaced with individual rules within sections of COBS. \nWe propose that these provisions cross-refer to the more general record-keeping \nrequirements in SYSC. The location of these is summarised in the proposed changes to \nSchedule 1 to COBS. \n3.34 \nOur proposed changes to COBS involve Articles 50 and 51 of the MiFID Org Reg \nbeing restated into the Handbook without amendment. We propose to consult on \nrequirements relating to the disclosure of costs and charges (including with respect \nto the requirements in Articles 50 and 51) as part of our consultation on the new \nretail disclosure regime that will replace the assimilated PRIIPs Regulation and UCITS \ndisclosure requirements. \nQuestion 4: \nDo you agree with our proposed changes to COBS? \n[agree] \n[neutral] \n[disagree] \nPlease explain your answer \n\n\n\n19  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarket Conduct\u00a0Sourcebook \n3.35 \nWe have made changes to the Handbook in relation to market conduct rules. \n3.36 \nArticles 77 to 79 of the MiFID Org Reg set out aspects of the regime for Small and \nMedium sized growth markets",

A number of EU directives, such as UCITS Directive, AIFMD, \nIDD, MiFID and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), included common operating \nstandards for firms, such as requirements to maintain adequate policies, procedures \nand control functions and responsibilities of management bodies (\u2018organisational rules\u2019). \nThey also included broadly similar standards on how firms conduct their activity with \nclients, such as conflicts of interest rules and information to be provided to clients. \n4.2 \nWhere possible, and supported in consultation responses, the FCA sought at the time of \ntransposing each EU directive to apply a common standard to firms conducting similar \nactivities",

For example, the common platform requirements in SYSC were devised to \nensure a single set of organisational requirements would apply to firms subject to both \nMiFID and the CRD, rather than applying similar but slightly different requirements from \nthese directives on the same business functions. \n4.3 \nOver time this became increasingly challenging. The law-making process for each \ndirective was independent of the others and each of them has been amended at \ndifferent times. In more recent directives, including MiFID II, IDD and AIFMD, many of the \ndetailed implementing measures were in the form of regulations (since transposed into \ndirectly applicable assimilated law). In these cases, the FCA had no scope to make minor \namendments to maintain a common standard across the files. \n4.4 \nThis resulted in largely duplicative rules across our Handbook with small differences \nin technical detail, and complex application rules needed to modify directly applicable \nobligations to apply to non-MIFID business. \n4.5 \nWe think there is scope to simplify and amend the provisions in our Handbook that stem \nfrom MiFID. We particularly want feedback on areas of complexity, confusion or over \nprescription which create regulatory cost with limited or no client benefit in addition \nto duplication where firms carry on business subject to multiple regimes.

Significant additional consumer \nprotection measures have been introduced in recent years for clients categorised \nas retail, including the Consumer Duty and restrictions in relation to certain higher \nrisk products such as leverage limits for Contracts for Difference (CFDs).

The firm must then adequately assess that the client\u2019s expertise, \nexperience, and knowledge is such that they are capable of making their own investment \ndecisions and understanding the risks involved in the anticipated investment, warn the \nclient of the protections they will lose, and obtain the client\u2019s written statement that \nthey are aware of the consequences of losing those protections. \n4.56 \nTherefore, the process of opting a contact up to elective professional status could carry \na risk of a contact believing they are being treated as a true client. \n4.57 \nCOBS 3.8 requirements to document processes for the assessment of a client\u2019s \ncategory, and to keep records sufficient to support such assessment, are not applicable \nin relation to corporate finance contacts.\u00a0However, a firm must comply with general \ngovernance and record keeping requirements, including SYSC 4 and SYSC 9. Under \nthese rules, firms are required to meet equivalent standards in relation to all of their \nactivities, including when treating contacts as elective professionals for the purpose of \nthe financial promotion rules",

Often the same \nrequirements apply to vastly different businesses. For example, suitability rules capture \na broad range of advice activities.

To \navoid unwarranted burden on firms that conducted limited activity and did not intend to \noffer services outside their own country, Article 3 of MiFID allowed Member States the \noption to exempt such firms from certain EU legislation, subject to certain conditions. \n4.73 \nIn taking up the MiFID Article 3 optional exemption, the UK added an option for firms \neligible for the Article 3 regime to opt-in to full MiFID investment firm authorisation. \n4.74 \nAdopting Article 3 allowed the FCA to exclude Article 3 firms from the definition \nof \u2018MiFID Investment Firm\u2019 and therefore from the scope of the CRD and other EU \nprudential regulation.
